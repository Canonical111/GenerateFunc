# Analytic Functional Generator

## Overview

This package is primarily designed to generate Analytic Functionals. It offers a range of tools and features aimed at simplifying and automating the creation process of Analytic Functionals.

## Current Status

- ЁЯЪл We **do not yet** support bosonic Plus type Analytic Functionals.
- тЪая╕П The current version is **not particularly efficient**.
- ЁЯЪз **Parallelization** is not well-handled.

## Compatibility

The generated hd5 files can be directly used in the package **Funboot**.

## Future Work

- Add support for bosonic Plus type Analytic Functionals.
- Optimize algorithms for better efficiency.
- Improve parallelization handling.

## Feedback & Contribution

Feel free to provide feedback and help us improve this package! Every suggestion and contribution counts.
